                <li>What happens if we got the price wrong. It is always possible that, despite our best efforts, some of the services we sell may be incorrectly priced. We will normally check prices before accepting your booking so that, where the correct price of the services at your booking date is less than our stated price at your booking date, we will charge the lower amount. If the correct price of the services at your booking date is higher than the price stated to you, we will contact you for your instructions before we accept your booking. </li>
                <li>How you must pay. We accept payment by credit or debit card. MedicSpot uses Stripe (<a href="<?php echo site_url('www.stripe.com');?>">www.stripe.com</a>) as a payment processor. Their terms and conditions can be found at <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/checkout/legal">https://stripe.com/gb/checkout/legal</a>. Your payment details will only be transferred to and processed by Stripe on their secure system in order to process your payment for our services. </li>
                <li>We can charge interest if you pay late. If you do not make any payment to us by the due date we may charge interest to you on the overdue amount at the rate of 4% a year above the base lending rate of the Bank of England from time to time. This interest shall accrue on a daily basis from the due date until the date of actual payment of the overdue amount, whether before or after judgment.

The reasons are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>we have told you about an error in the price or description of the services you have booked and you do not wish to proceed;</li>
                        <li>there is a risk that supply of the services may be significantly delayed because of events outside our control; or</li>

                   <li>Ending the contract where we are not at fault and there is no right to change your mind. Even if we are not at fault and you do not have a right to change your mind, you can still end the contract before it is completed, but you may have to pay us compensation. A contract for services is completed when we have finished providing the services and you have paid for them. If you want to end a contract before it is completed where we are not at fault and you have not changed your mind, just contact us to let us know. The contract will end immediately and we will refund any sums paid by you for services not provided but we may deduct from that refund (or, if you have not made an advance payment, charge you) reasonable compensation for the net costs we will incur as a result of your ending the contract.</li>

                 <li>We are under a legal duty to provide services that are in conformity with this contract. </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Our responsibility for loss or damage suffered by you
            <ol>
                <li>We are responsible to you for foreseeable loss and damage caused by us. If we fail to comply with these terms, we are responsible for loss or damage you suffer that is a foreseeable result of our breaking this contract or our failing to use reasonable care and skill, but we are not responsible for any loss or damage that is not foreseeable. Loss or damage is foreseeable if either it is obvious that it will happen or if, at the time the contract was made, both we and you knew it might happen.</li>
                <li>We do not exclude or limit in any way our liability to you where it would be unlawful to do so. This includes liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence or the negligence of our employees, agents or subcontractors; for fraud or fraudulent misrepresentation; or for breach of your legal rights in relation to the services.</li>
                <li>We are not liable for business losses. We only supply the services for domestic and private use. If you use the services for any commercial, business or re-sale purpose we will have no liability to you for any loss of profit, loss of business, business interruption, or loss of business opportunity.</li>
                <li>Third parties. We will not be liable for any loss or damage suffered by you, any third party or any property arising out of or in connection with the acts or omissions of any third party, including in circumstances where you were referred to such third party by us or where such third party was recommended to you by us.</li>
                <li>Our mobile application and our clinical stations, including the computer and medical equipment contained therein, are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo;, &ldquo;where is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo;. You acknowledge that we have not and do not warrant or guarantee the performance of our mobile application or our clinical stations (including the connection to the internet and public telecommunications network) or any aspect or portion thereof. Neither do we guarantee that our mobile application or the connection at the clinical stations will be uninterrupted or error free or that certain results may be obtained by anyone in connection with their use.</li>
                
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>How we may use your personal information
            <ol>
                <li>How we will use your personal information. We will use the personal information you provide to us:
                    <ol>
                        <li>to provide the services to you; and</li>
                        <li>to process your payment for the services.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Where you provide us with special types of personal information, including information relating to your health or sex life, we will only process such information in so far as it is necessary in order to provide you with health care or treatment. We will not process this information for any other purpose, including providing it to your personal clinician, without your express consent.</li>
                <li>We will only give your personal information to third parties with your consent or where the law either requires or allows us to do so.</li>
                <li>We will only retain your personal information for as long as is necessary to provide the services to you.</li>
                <li>For more information on how we may process your personal data, please refer to our privacy and data protection policy <a href="<?php echo site_url('www.medicspot.co.uk/privacy');?>">www.medicspot.co.uk/privacy</a> .</li>
                
            </ol>
          </li>
            <li>Other important terms
                <ol>
                    <li>We may transfer this agreement to someone else. We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.</li>
                    <li>You need our consent to transfer your rights to someone else (except that you can always transfer our guarantee). You may only transfer your rights or your obligations under these terms to another person if we agree to this in writing.</li>
                    <li>Nobody else has any rights under this contract. This contract is between you and us. No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. Neither of us will need to get the agreement of any other person in order to end the contract or make any changes to these terms.</li>
                        <li>If a court finds part of this contract illegal, the rest will continue in force. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect.</li>
                        <li>Even if we delay in enforcing this contract, we can still enforce it later. If we do not insist immediately that you do anything you are required to do under these terms, or if we delay in taking steps against you in respect of your breaking this contract, that will not mean that you do not have to do those things and it will not prevent us taking steps against you at a later date. </li>
                        <li>Which laws apply to this contract and where you may bring legal proceedings. These terms are governed by English law and you can bring legal proceedings in respect of the services in the English courts. </li>
                </ol>
